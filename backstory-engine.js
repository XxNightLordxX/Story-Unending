      "The alarm went off at 5:45 AM, the same time it had gone off every morning for the past two years. I reached for it without opening my eyes, muscle memory guiding my hand to the phone on the nightstand. The apartment was cold—I kept the heat low to save money—and the first breath of morning air tasted like dust and instant coffee from the pot I'd set to auto-brew the night before.",
      "My apartment was small enough that I could stand in the center and almost touch both walls. A studio on the fourth floor of a building that had stopped being charming sometime in the nineties. The wallpaper peeled in the corners, the radiator clanked like a prisoner tapping messages through pipes, and the window faced another building's brick wall. But the rent was cheap, and cheap was the only language my bank account spoke.",
      "The morning commute was forty minutes by train if the schedule held, which it rarely did. I stood in the same spot on the platform every day, earbuds in, hood up, watching the same faces pretend not to see each other. The city moved around me like a river around a stone—constant, indifferent, unstoppable.",
      "I worked at a warehouse on the east side of the city. Twelve-hour shifts, four days a week, loading and unloading crates that contained things I'd never be able to afford. The pay was enough to cover rent, Yuna's hospital bills—barely—and food that came in packages designed to survive nuclear winters. It wasn't a career. It was a life support system for a life that had stopped feeling like living.",
      "The convenience store on the corner knew my order before I said it. Two rice balls, a can of coffee, and whatever bento was marked down for quick sale. The woman behind the counter—Mrs. Tanaka, though I'd never asked her name, just read it on the tag—had stopped making small talk months ago. She'd learned that I wasn't rude, just empty. There's a difference, and people who work night shifts understand it.",
      "5:45 AM. The numbers glowed red on my phone screen, the same numbers that had greeted me every morning for two years. I didn't need an alarm anymore. My body had learned to wake up at the exact moment survival required it. The apartment was dark and cold and quiet, and for a moment I lay there wondering if this was all there was—waking up, surviving, doing it again tomorrow.",
      "The shower took five minutes. Three minutes to get wet, two minutes to soap and rinse. I timed it because hot water cost money and I couldn't afford to be generous with things that had price tags. The water pressure was weak and the temperature fluctuated between lukewarm and cold, but it was water and it was clean and that was more than some people had. I told myself this every morning. It helped less each time.",
      "Breakfast was instant coffee and a rice ball from the convenience store. I ate standing up, leaning against the counter, watching the morning light struggle through the dirty window. The coffee was bitter and the rice ball was stale, but they were fuel and fuel was what I needed. Taste was a luxury I'd given up along with hope and the belief that things would get better.",
      "The train arrived at 6:23 AM, exactly when it was supposed to. I boarded with the same people I boarded with every day—tired faces, empty eyes, bodies moving through the motions of living without actually being alive. We stood together in silence, a community of strangers bound together by shared exhaustion and the understanding that none of us would acknowledge each other's existence.",
      "The warehouse smelled of cardboard and dust and the metallic tang of machinery. I'd worked there for eighteen months and the smell had become the smell of my life. My hands were calloused and my back ached constantly and I went home every night feeling like I'd been used up and discarded. But the paycheck came every two weeks and that was what mattered. That was the only thing that mattered.",
      "My supervisor was a man named Tanaka who spoke in grunts and hand gestures. He'd never asked about my life and I'd never asked about his. We had an understanding: I showed up on time, I worked hard, I didn't complain, and he paid me. It wasn't friendship. It wasn't even respect. It was a transaction, clean and simple, and in a world where everything was complicated, I appreciated the simplicity.",
      "Lunch was thirty minutes. I ate in the break room with the other workers, but I didn't talk to them. They talked about sports and television and weekend plans, things that belonged to a world I no longer inhabited. I ate my bento and stared at the wall and counted the minutes until I could go back to work. Work was easier than conversation. Work didn't ask questions I couldn't answer.",
      "The afternoon shift was harder than the morning. My body was tired and my mind was foggy and the crates seemed heavier than they had in the morning. But I kept moving because stopping wasn't an option. Stopping meant thinking and thinking was dangerous. Thinking led to remembering and remembering led to pain and I couldn't afford pain. I couldn't afford anything that wasn't absolutely necessary for survival.",
      "The train ride home was different from the morning commute. In the morning, everyone was moving toward something—work, school, obligations. In the evening, everyone was moving away from something, and the energy in the train car was different. We were all escaping, if only for an hour, before we had to return to whatever lives we'd built for ourselves.",
      "The hospital was three stops from my apartment. I got off the train at 6:47 PM, exactly when I'd gotten off every day for two years. The walk to the hospital was familiar—turn left at the convenience store, pass the park where Yuna used to play, cross the street at the crosswalk where the traffic light always took too long to change. I could have walked it in my sleep. Sometimes I felt like I was.",
      "Room 414 was on the fourth floor, down the hall from the nurses' station and around the corner from the vending machines that dispensed coffee that tasted like battery acid. I knew every step of the journey. I knew which floorboards creaked and which elevator buttons were sticky and which nurses smiled and which ones didn't. The hospital had become my second home, though it was the kind of home you never wanted to have.",
      "Yuna was where she always was—in the bed, surrounded by machines, connected to tubes and wires that kept her alive when her body had forgotten how. She looked smaller every time I saw her, though the doctors said she wasn't losing weight. It was something else—something about the way the light hit her face, something about the stillness of her hands. She was fading, slowly and inexorably, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.",
      "I sat in the chair beside her bed—the same chair I'd sat in for two years—and took her hand. It was warm, which was the only thing that mattered. Warm meant alive. Warm meant there was still hope, however small, however fragile. I talked to her about my day, about the warehouse, about the train ride, about nothing important. I talked because silence was too heavy to carry alone.",
      "The nurses came in every hour to check her vitals. They moved efficiently, professionally, like they'd done this a thousand times before. They probably had. They smiled at me and asked how I was doing and I said fine because that was the answer they wanted. The truth was too complicated. The truth was that I wasn't doing fine. The truth was that I was barely doing at all.",
      "I left the hospital at 8:00 PM. The walk to my apartment was dark and quiet and I moved through it like a ghost, barely present in my own life. The city felt different at night—less oppressive, more forgiving. The darkness covered things that the light exposed. The darkness was easier.",
      "My apartment was cold when I got home. I turned on the space heater and waited for it to warm up, shivering in my coat. The radiator clanked and hissed and eventually produced a weak heat that barely took the edge off the chill. But it was better than nothing. Everything was better than nothing.",
      "Dinner was instant ramen. I ate it at the small table that served as my kitchen, dining room, and desk. The broth was salty and the noodles were soft and I ate mechanically, without tasting. Food was fuel. That was all it was. That was all it could be.",
      "I went to bed at 10:00 PM. The sheets were cold and the pillow was flat and the mattress was lumpy, but I was too tired to care. I lay in the dark and listened to the city—the distant traffic, the neighbor's television, the radiator's rhythmic clanking. These were the sounds of my life. These were the only sounds I had.",
      "Sleep came eventually, though it never felt like rest. It felt more like a temporary death, a pause in the endless cycle of waking and surviving and doing it again tomorrow. I dreamed sometimes, though I never remembered the dreams. I was grateful for that. Dreams were dangerous. Dreams showed you things you couldn't have.",
      "The alarm went off at 5:45 AM. I reached for it without opening my eyes, and the cycle began again.",
      "The winter was harder than the summer. The cold seeped through the walls of my apartment like a slow invasion, and the radiator fought a losing battle against the physics of heat transfer. I wore three layers to sleep and woke up shivering, my breath visible in the air like ghost words I couldn't read. The heating bill came every month, a reminder that warmth was a luxury I couldn't afford.",
      `I found a wallet on the train once. Black leather, worn at the edges, containing a driver's license, credit cards, and three hundred dollars in cash. I turned it in to the station attendant, who looked at me like I was an idiot. "Keep it," he said. "Nobody would know." But I would know. That was the problem with being alone with your conscience—there was nowhere to hide from it.`,
      "The convenience store changed ownership. Mrs. Tanaka retired, replaced by a younger man who didn't know my order and didn't care to learn. The rice balls were different—smaller, less fresh, more expensive. It was a small change, but it felt like losing something. The world kept changing without my permission, and every change was a reminder that nothing stayed the same, not even the things I'd counted on.",
      "I got sick once. Just a cold, but it knocked me flat for three days. I lay in bed with a fever, too weak to move, too stubborn to go to the doctor because doctors cost money. I drank water from the tap and ate crackers from the pantry and waited for my body to remember how to fight. It was the loneliest I'd ever been—sick and alone in a cold apartment, with no one to bring me soup or check if I was still alive.",
      "The train broke down once. Stuck between stations for forty minutes in the middle of summer with no air conditioning. The car was packed, bodies pressed together, heat rising like a physical weight. People complained and cursed and checked their phones, but I just stood there and breathed. It was the first time in months I'd felt warm, really warm, and I closed my eyes and pretended it was a vacation instead of a failure of public transportation.",
      "I started counting things. Steps to the train station. Crates loaded per hour. Minutes between hospital visits. Numbers were safe. Numbers didn't have feelings. Numbers didn't remind me of anything. I counted everything, and for a while, it helped. Then I started counting the days since the accident, and I had to stop.",
      "The landlord raised the rent. Not by much—just fifty dollars a month—but it was another weight on a scale that was already tipping. I asked if there was anything I could do, any work I could trade for the increase. He looked at me like I was pathetic and said no. So I paid it, and I ate less, and I told myself it was fine. Everything was fine. Everything was always fine.",
      "I found an old photo album in the closet. Pictures from before I was born, pictures of my parents as young people, pictures of a life I'd never known. They looked happy. They looked like they had a future. I looked at those photos for hours, trying to see the people they became, trying to understand how they went from those smiling faces to the people who died in a car crash. I never figured it out.",
      "The warehouse got a new supervisor. Tanaka retired, replaced by a younger man with a clipboard and an MBA and no patience for people who worked with their hands. He changed everything—the schedules, the procedures, the way we stacked the crates. He said it was for efficiency. I said it was for control. We didn't get along.",
      "I stopped wearing a watch. Time was just another thing I couldn't control, another thing that moved forward without my permission. I woke up when my body told me to. I went to work when the schedule said to. I visited the hospital when visiting hours allowed. I lived by external rhythms instead of internal ones, and it was easier that way. Less thinking. Less feeling. Less being.",
      "The city had festivals. Summer festivals, autumn festivals, winter festivals, spring festivals. People dressed up and ate food and watched fireworks and pretended that life was something to celebrate. I walked through the crowds sometimes, anonymous and invisible, watching other people be happy. It was like watching a movie about a world I didn't live in anymore.",
      `I started talking to myself. Not crazy talking—just muttering comments under my breath, narrating my day like someone was listening. "Need milk," I'd say at the convenience store. "Long line today," I'd say at the train station. It was better than silence. Silence was too empty. Silence had room for thoughts I didn't want to think.`,
      "The hospital cafeteria had terrible coffee. Bitter, watery, overpriced. I drank it anyway, sitting at a table by the window, watching the parking lot fill and empty. It was my routine—coffee, window, waiting. Sometimes I'd see other people waiting, other people with the same exhausted faces, and we'd nod at each other like members of a club nobody wanted to join.",
      "I learned to fix things. Not well—YouTube tutorials and trial and error—but enough to keep things working. The leaky faucet. The broken drawer. The flickering light. Dad would have been proud. Or maybe he would have been sad that I had to learn these things alone. I didn't know. I never asked him. I never would.",
      "The seasons changed. Winter to spring, spring to summer, summer to autumn, autumn to winter. The world kept turning, the calendar kept flipping, and I kept moving through it like a ghost. Time passed, but I didn't. I was stuck in the moment of the accident, frozen in the space between before and after, and nothing could make me move forward.",
      "Yuna had a collection of stuffed animals. Not the expensive kind—gifts from relatives, prizes from school festivals, things she'd found at thrift stores and loved anyway. They sat on her bed in the hospital, a silent audience watching over her. Sometimes I arranged them in different positions, like she used to do. It was stupid, but it made me feel like I was doing something.",
      "The doctors talked about Yuna like she was a puzzle they couldn't solve. They showed me brain scans and explained neural pathways and used words I had to look up later. They were smart people, dedicated people, people who wanted to help. But they couldn't, and I could see it in their eyes every time they gave me an update. They were running out of hope, and I was running out of time.",
      "Yuna's friends stopped coming after the first month. Not because they didn't care—they did, I know they did—but because visiting a comatose friend is hard. It's sad and it's awkward and it's a reminder that life is fragile and unfair. So they stopped coming, and I didn't blame them. I wouldn't have wanted to visit me either.",
      "I found Yuna's diary once. I wasn't looking for it—I was cleaning her room, trying to make it less like a shrine and more like a room—and there it was, tucked under her mattress. I didn't read it. That would have been a violation, a betrayal of the privacy she couldn't defend anymore. I put it back where I found it, and I never looked for it again.",
      "The hospital had a policy about visitors. Only family during certain hours, only two at a time, no children under twelve. I followed all the rules, even the ones that didn't make sense. Rules were structure, and structure was what I needed. If I followed the rules, I was doing things right. If I was doing things right, maybe things would get better. They never did.",
      "Yuna's hair kept growing. The nurses trimmed it sometimes, but it grew anyway, slow and steady, like time itself. I brushed it every visit, running the comb through the strands the way Mom used to brush mine when I was little. It was a small thing, a meaningless thing, but it was something I could do, something active, something that felt like caring.",
      "The hospital had a gift shop. I bought things there sometimes—flowers, cards, small stuffed animals. I put them in Yuna's room, on the windowsill, on the nightstand, anywhere there was space. The room was full of things I'd bought, evidence of my love in physical form. It wasn't enough. It was never enough.",
      "I talked to Yuna about the future sometimes. Not the future where she woke up—I couldn't let myself hope for that—but the future where she didn't. I told her about the arrangements I'd made, the funeral home I'd chosen, the plot I'd bought next to Mom and Dad. I told her because I needed to say it out loud, because saying it made it real, and making it real was the only way I could survive it.",
      "The hospital had a social worker. A woman with kind eyes and a clipboard and a degree in helping people who couldn't be helped. She asked me how I was doing, if I needed anything, if I wanted to talk. I said I was fine, I didn't need anything, I didn't want to talk. I lied. I lied because the truth was too complicated, because the truth was that I wasn't doing at all.",
      "Yuna's room had a clock. A digital clock on the wall, red numbers glowing in the dark. I watched those numbers change every visit—6:47, 6:48, 6:49—marking time that passed without her. Time was the enemy now. Time was what was taking her away, second by second, minute by minute, and I couldn't stop it. I could only watch.",
      "Mom had a collection of cookbooks. Not the fancy kind with glossy photos, but old ones, passed down from her mother and her grandmother, with stained pages and handwritten notes in the margins. She cooked from memory mostly, but sometimes she'd pull out a book and try something new, and the kitchen would smell like spices and experimentation and love. I still have those cookbooks. I still can't bring myself to open them.",
      "Dad was a quiet man. Not silent—he spoke when he had something to say—but quiet in the way that some people are just naturally low-volume. He didn't need to fill every silence with words. He was comfortable with quiet, and he taught me to be comfortable with it too. Now my life is nothing but quiet, and I'm not comfortable with it at all.",
      `My parents met at a library. Mom was studying for an exam, Dad was returning a book, and they reached for the same copy of "The Great Gatsby" at the same time. They used to tell that story at dinner parties, laughing about how romantic it wasn't. "It was just a book," Mom would say. "It was a very good book," Dad would say, and they'd smile at each other like they were sharing a secret. I don't know what the secret was. I never asked.`,
      "Mom was afraid of heights. Not mildly afraid—terrified. She wouldn't go on ladders, she wouldn't look out of windows on high floors, she wouldn't even watch movies with scenes on tall buildings. Dad thought it was funny. He'd tease her about it, standing on chairs and pretending to wobble, and she'd swat him away and tell him to stop being an idiot. They were happy. They were so happy.",
      "Dad had a scar on his chin. A thin white line, barely visible unless you were looking for it. He got it when he was a kid, falling off a bicycle and hitting the pavement. He used to tell me stories about how it happened—different stories every time, each more ridiculous than the last. A shark attack. A ninja fight. An alien abduction. I believed every one of them until I was ten, when Mom told me the truth. I still liked his versions better.",
      "Mom kept a journal. Not a diary—she hated that word—but a journal, where she wrote about her day, her thoughts, her feelings. She showed it to me once, when I was having a hard time at school, to show me that everyone struggled sometimes. I haven't read it since she died. It feels like violating her privacy, like seeing parts of her she never meant anyone to see. But I keep it, just in case.",
      "Dad was a morning person. He woke up at 5:00 AM every day, even on weekends, even on vacation. He'd make coffee and read the newspaper and watch the sun come up, and he said it was the best part of the day—quiet, peaceful, full of possibility. I hated mornings. I still do. But sometimes, when I wake up early, I make coffee and watch the sun come up, and I think about him.",
      "Mom had a laugh that could fill a room. Not loud—she wasn't a loud person—but bright and sudden and impossible to fake. When she laughed, you wanted to laugh too, even if you didn't know what was funny. I haven't heard that laugh in two years, and sometimes I think I'll never hear anything like it again.",
      "Dad was terrible at telling jokes. He'd forget the punchline, or get the timing wrong, or tell a joke that didn't make any sense at all. But he kept trying, because he liked making people laugh, and we kept laughing, not because the jokes were funny but because he was trying. That was the thing about Dad—he always tried.",
      `Mom was the one who taught me to read. Not the school way, with phonics and worksheets, but the real way, sitting on the couch with a book and pointing at words and sounding them out together. She was patient, endlessly patient, even when I was frustrated and wanted to give up. "Reading is a superpower," she'd say. "Once you can read, you can go anywhere." She was right. But she didn't tell me that sometimes you read to escape from where you are.`,
      "The first time I paid a bill, I cried. Not because it was hard—I could figure out how to write a check and mail it—but because it was so adult, so final, so completely unlike anything I'd ever done before. I was eighteen years old, paying an electric bill for an apartment I couldn't afford, and I felt like a child playing dress-up in clothes that were too big.",
      "I learned to cook by necessity. Not well—my repertoire was limited to about six dishes, all of them involving rice—but well enough to keep myself alive. I followed recipes from the internet, watched YouTube tutorials, made mistakes and learned from them. Dad would have been proud. Or maybe he would have laughed at my attempts. I didn't know. I never asked.",
      "The apartment was too big for one person. Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living room, a kitchen, a dining room—space designed for a family of four, now occupied by one. I lived in the master bedroom and let the other rooms sit empty, gathering dust, like monuments to people who weren't there anymore. Sometimes I went into Yuna's room and just stood there, breathing in the air that still smelled like her.",
      "I stopped going to school. Not officially—I was still enrolled, technically—but I stopped attending classes, stopped doing homework, stopped caring about grades. The school called, of course. They sent letters, they left messages, they threatened to expel me. I didn't care. What was the point of education when my life had already fallen apart? What was the point of planning a future I didn't believe in?",
      "The loneliness was physical. It was a weight in my chest, a tightness in my throat, a hollow ache behind my eyes. I was surrounded by people—at work, on the train, in the hospital—but I was completely alone. No one knew what I was going through. No one could know. Grief is a solitary experience, even when you're surrounded by people who love you, and I didn't even have that.",
      "I developed rituals. Not religious rituals—I wasn't praying to anyone—but personal ones, small acts of order in a chaotic world. I made coffee the same way every morning. I visited Yuna at the same time every day. I walked the same route to the warehouse. These rituals were anchors, things I could hold onto when everything else felt like it was spinning away.",
      "The anger came later. Not at first—at first there was just shock and grief and the overwhelming need to survive. But after the shock faded and the grief settled into something manageable, the anger came. Anger at the truck driver who ran the red light. Anger at the hospital for being so expensive. Anger at the universe for being so unfair. Anger at my parents for leaving me. Anger at myself for not being able to fix any of it.",
      "I learned to be invisible. At work, I did my job without drawing attention to myself. On the train, I blended into the crowd. In the hospital, I was just another visitor in a sea of visitors. Being invisible was safer. Being invisible meant no one asked questions. Being invisible meant I could just exist, without expectations or obligations or the need to perform for other people.",
      "The hardest part was the small things. The way the apartment was too quiet. The way no one asked how my day was. The way I had to make all the decisions alone, even the small ones like what to eat for dinner or when to go to bed. These small things accumulated, day after day, until they felt like a weight I couldn't carry.",
      "I became good at pretending. Pretending I was fine. Pretending I knew what I was doing. Pretending I had everything under control. I pretended so well that sometimes I almost believed it myself. But then I'd come home to an empty apartment or sit alone in a hospital room or wake up in the middle of the night with no one to call, and the pretending would crack, and underneath was the truth: I was drowning, and I didn't know how to swim.",
      "The game was called Endless Realms. Endless. That word stuck with me. Endless possibilities. Endless adventures. Endless life. My life felt like the opposite of endless. It felt finite, limited, bounded by grief and responsibility and the crushing weight of survival. The game offered something my life didn't: a future. A future that wasn't just more of the same.",
      "The technology was revolutionary. Full neural interface. Direct brain-to-game connection. No controllers, no screens, no barriers between you and the virtual world. They said it felt more real than reality. They said you'd forget which world was which. They said it would change everything. I was skeptical. I was always skeptical. But even I had to admit—it was impressive.",
      "The cost was astronomical. The headset alone was five hundred dollars. Then there was the subscription fee, the in-game purchases, the premium content. People were spending thousands of dollars on a game that didn't exist. I couldn't understand it. I could barely afford to keep my sister alive in the real world. The idea of spending that kind of money on a virtual one was incomprehensible to me.",
      "The launch was a global event. Millions of people logging in simultaneously. Servers crashing under the load. Social media exploding with screenshots and stories and first impressions. The news covered it like it was a moon landing. The biggest entertainment launch in history. The dawn of a new era. I watched it all from the sidelines, feeling like I was missing something fundamental about being human.",
      "The game promised everything. Unlimited exploration. Infinite possibilities. A world where you could be anyone, do anything, go anywhere. No limits, no consequences, no reality to hold you back. People talked about it like it was a religion, like logging in was a form of salvation. I didn't get it. I didn't get how a virtual world could be better than the real one, even when the real one was terrible.",
      `Hiro was obsessed. He talked about it constantly, during breaks at the warehouse, during lunch, during the rare moments when we weren't working. He'd pre-ordered the headset months ago, paid extra for overnight shipping, planned his character build with the intensity of someone planning a military operation. "You should get one too," he said. "It's going to be huge." I said I couldn't afford it, which was true, but also I didn't want it. I didn't want to escape into a virtual world. I wanted to fix the real one.`,
      "I found the headset in a box of Dad's things. I was going through his workshop, sorting through tools and projects I didn't understand, and there it was—wrapped in bubble wrap, tucked in the back of a drawer. No note, no explanation, just the headset and a receipt dated three months before the accident. He'd bought it for me. He'd bought it and never told me, and now he was gone and I'd never know why.",
      "The headset was expensive. I looked it up online—five hundred dollars, plus tax, plus shipping. Dad had paid for overnight delivery. He'd wanted me to have it on launch day. He'd wanted me to be part of whatever this was. But he'd never given it to me. Maybe he was waiting for my birthday. Maybe he was waiting for the right moment. Maybe he'd just forgotten. I'd never know.",
      "I almost threw it away. That was my first instinct. I didn't want it. I didn't want anything that reminded me of Dad, of the accident, of the life we used to have. But I couldn't bring myself to do it. It was the last thing he'd ever bought for me. Throwing it away felt like throwing him away, like erasing the last piece of evidence that he'd existed, that he'd loved me.",
      "The headset sat on my desk for weeks. I looked at it every day, but I didn't touch it. It was like a bomb that might go off if I handled it wrong. A bomb made of grief and guilt and questions I couldn't answer. What did Dad want me to do with it? Why did he buy it? What was he trying to tell me? I didn't know. I didn't know anything anymore.",
      "I finally opened the box on a Tuesday night. I don't know why Tuesday. I don't know why that night. Maybe I was just tired of looking at it. Maybe I was just tired of wondering. I opened the box and took out the headset and it was heavier than I expected, sleek and black and impossibly advanced, like something from a science fiction movie.",
      "The instructions were simple. Put on the headset. Connect to your phone. Follow the on-screen prompts. That was it. No setup, no configuration, no technical knowledge required. The technology was designed to be accessible to everyone, from gamers to grandmothers. I read the instructions three times, then put the headset back in the box. I wasn't ready. I didn't know if I'd ever be ready."];

    const middles = [
      "My days had a rhythm that was less like music and more like a heartbeat monitor—steady, predictable, and only interesting when something went wrong. Wake up. Train. Work. Train. Hospital. Home. Sleep. Repeat. The weekends were the same minus the work, plus longer hours sitting beside Yuna's bed, reading to her from books she used to love, pretending she could hear me. Maybe she could. The doctors said brain activity was present but unpredictable. I chose to believe the optimistic interpretation.",
      "I didn't have friends, exactly. I had coworkers who nodded at me and a landlord who texted when rent was late. There was Hiro from the warehouse, who sometimes shared his lunch and talked about football with the enthusiasm of someone who needed another person to hear him. I listened. It cost me nothing, and his wife made incredible tamagoyaki that he always packed too much of. That was the closest thing to a social life I had—borrowed food and borrowed conversation.",
      "The apartment had three photos on the wall. One of Mom and Dad, taken at a festival when I was six—Dad's arm around Mom's shoulders, both of them laughing at something I'd said that I couldn't remember. One of Yuna at her school recital, gap-toothed and proud in a dress she'd picked out herself. And one of all four of us, the last family photo, taken three months before the accident that took my parents and put my sister in a bed she hadn't left since. I didn't look at them often. But I couldn't take them down.",
      "Money was a constant pressure, like gravity but meaner. Yuna's hospital bills arrived with the regularity of seasons, each one a reminder that keeping someone alive was expensive and that insurance had limits that felt like cruelty. I'd sold everything worth selling—Dad's watch, Mom's jewelry, the car, most of the furniture from the old apartment. What was left was what couldn't be converted to cash: memories, obligations, and a stubbornness that I'd inherited from both parents in equal measure.",
      "I cooked the same three meals in rotation: rice with eggs, instant ramen with whatever vegetables were on sale, and curry from a box that cost less than a bus ticket. Nutrition was a concept I understood theoretically but practiced poorly. My body ran on caffeine, carbohydrates, and the kind of determination that looks a lot like exhaustion from the outside. I was twenty years old and I moved like someone who'd been carrying weight for much longer.",
      "The nights were the hardest. Not because of loneliness—I'd made peace with that, or at least a ceasefire—but because the silence left room for thinking. And thinking, for me, always circled back to the same questions. Why did the car crash happen? Why did Mom and Dad die but Yuna survive? Why did surviving look so much like not living? The questions didn't have answers. They just had weight. And every night, I carried them to bed and set them on the pillow beside me.",
      "I had a routine for everything. A routine for waking up, a routine for getting dressed, a routine for eating, a routine for working, a routine for visiting Yuna, a routine for sleeping. Routines were safe. Routines were predictable. Routines didn't require decisions, and decisions were dangerous because decisions led to thinking and thinking led to remembering and remembering led to pain. So I lived by routine, and the routine kept me alive, if not exactly living.",
      "The warehouse had a rhythm too. The forklifts moved in patterns, the workers followed established routes, the crates were stacked in predetermined configurations. I fit into this rhythm easily. I became part of it. For twelve hours a day, four days a week, I was a component in a machine, and that was easier than being a person with a life that had fallen apart.",
      "I stopped looking at people. Not because I didn't want to see them, but because seeing them meant acknowledging their existence and acknowledging their existence meant they might acknowledge mine, and I couldn't handle that. I couldn't handle questions about how I was doing or what I was planning or whether things were getting better. Things weren't getting better. Things were never going to get better, and I didn't want to talk about it.",
      "The train became my sanctuary. Not because it was comfortable or pleasant—it was neither—but because it was anonymous. On the train, I was just another tired body in a sea of tired bodies. No one asked me anything. No one expected anything from me. I could disappear into the crowd and for forty minutes, I didn't have to be anyone at all.",
      "I learned to find comfort in small things. The warmth of the shower on a cold morning. The first sip of coffee, bitter though it was. The feeling of clean sheets on a tired body. These weren't happiness—happiness was too big, too complicated—but they were something close enough. They were moments when the weight lifted, just a little, and I could breathe.",
      "Time became strange. Days blurred together, indistinguishable from each other. Weeks passed without me noticing. Months accumulated like dust in corners. I marked time not by calendars or clocks but by Yuna's hospital bills and the changing seasons and the slow, imperceptible changes in my own body—the way my hair grew longer, the way my hands got rougher, the way my reflection in the mirror became someone I barely recognized.",
      "I stopped dreaming of the future. The future was a concept that belonged to a different version of me, a version who had parents and a sister who was awake and a life that made sense. That version was gone. The present was all I had, and the present was just surviving, just getting through one day so I could get through the next.",
      "The city felt different after the accident. Before, it had been a place of possibility—somewhere to go, something to do, someone to become. After, it was just a backdrop, a setting for the endless repetition of my survival. The buildings were taller, the crowds were denser, the noise was louder, but none of it touched me. I moved through it like a ghost, present but not really there.",
      "I developed a relationship with silence. Not the comfortable silence of companionship, but the heavy silence of absence. The silence of an apartment that was too quiet because it was missing people. The silence of a hospital room where the only sounds were machines. The silence of a life that had lost its music. I learned to live in that silence, to breathe it, to let it fill the spaces where words used to be.",
      "There were moments when I forgot. Not forgot that they were gone—I could never forget that—but forgot what it felt like when they were here. I'd reach for the phone to call Mom, then remember. I'd start to tell Yuna about my day, then remember. I'd see something funny and want to share it with Dad, then remember. These moments were the worst, because they were reminders of what I'd lost, not just once but over and over again.",
      "I stopped making plans. Plans were for people with futures, and I didn't have a future. I had a present that was just surviving and a past that was just grief. So I lived day to day, hour to hour, moment to moment, and I didn't think about what came next because thinking about what came next was too painful.",
      "The physical exhaustion helped. When my body was tired enough, my mind stopped working so hard. The questions got quieter, the memories got fuzzier, the pain got duller. Sleep became not just a necessity but a refuge, a place where I didn't have to be anyone or feel anything or remember anything. I slept as much as I could, which was never enough.",
      "I became good at waiting. Waiting for the train, waiting for work to end, waiting for visiting hours at the hospital, waiting for sleep, waiting for morning. My life was a series of waits, and I moved through them with the patience of someone who had learned that rushing didn't make anything come faster.",
      "The routine was my armor. It protected me from the world, from questions, from expectations, from the possibility of hope. Hope was dangerous. Hope made you want things, and wanting things led to disappointment, and I couldn't handle any more disappointment. So I lived by routine, and the routine kept me safe.",
      "I developed a system for everything. A system for laundry (Sundays). A system for grocery shopping (Tuesdays). A system for paying bills (Fridays). Systems were predictable. Systems didn't require decisions. Systems were the opposite of chaos, and chaos was what I was trying to avoid.",
      "The warehouse had a cat. A stray that wandered in one day and never left. The workers fed it scraps and gave it water and let it sleep in the warm spots near the machinery. I liked that cat. It didn't ask anything from anyone. It just existed, and that was enough. Sometimes I felt like that cat—just existing, taking what was given, asking for nothing more.",
      "I started reading again. Not for pleasure—pleasure was a luxury I couldn't afford—but for distraction. I read books from the library, books from the bargain bin, books people left on the train. I read anything I could get my hands on, and for a few hours, I could be somewhere else, someone else, in a world where things made sense.",
      "The train had a regular cast of characters. The businessman who always fell asleep and missed his stop. The student who studied for exams with frantic intensity. The old woman who brought knitting and never finished anything. I watched them like they were characters in a show, and for a while, I wasn't the only one who was lonely.",
      "I learned to cook better. Not good—just better than terrible. I found recipes online, bought cheap ingredients, practiced on weekends. The food was still simple, still cheap, but it tasted like something a human might actually want to eat. Dad would have been proud. Or maybe he would have laughed at my attempts. I didn't know. I never asked.",
      "The hospital had a garden. A small patch of grass and flowers behind the building, where patients and visitors could sit and breathe air that didn't smell like antiseptic. I went there sometimes, when the weather was nice, and I'd sit on a bench and watch the bees move between flowers. It was peaceful. It was the closest thing to normal I had.",
      "I stopped watching the news. It was all the same—war, disaster, tragedy, repeat. The world was a terrible place, and I already knew that. I didn't need to be reminded every hour of every day. So I stopped watching, and for a while, I felt better. Then I realized that not knowing didn't make things better, it just made me ignorant, and I started watching again.",
      "The convenience store started selling premade meals. Not great meals—microwaveable things with too much sodium and not enough nutrition—but they were hot and they were cheap and they were better than instant ramen. I bought one every Friday, a small luxury, a small reward for surviving another week. It wasn't much, but it was something.",
      "I learned to recognize the sounds of my apartment. The radiator's clank. The neighbor's television. The footsteps in the hallway. These sounds became familiar, comforting in their way. They were the sounds of my life, the soundtrack of my survival, and I knew them better than I knew anything else.",
      "The warehouse had a break room with a vending machine. The machine had a glitch—sometimes it would give you two items instead of one. I discovered this by accident, pressing the button for a soda and getting two. I felt guilty, like I'd stolen something, but I took them both anyway. It was the closest thing to good luck I'd had in two years.",
      "I started writing. Not a journal—journals were for people with feelings worth recording—but lists. Lists of things I needed to do. Lists of things I'd done. Lists of things I couldn't change. Lists were orderly. Lists were manageable. Lists were the opposite of the chaos in my head.",
      "The train had a delay announcement system. A robotic voice that apologized for inconveniences and promised to get us to our destinations as soon as possible. I heard that voice every day, sometimes multiple times a day, and I started to believe it. The apology, the promise, the hope that things would get better. Even though they never did.",
      "I learned to appreciate small victories. Finding a sale on rice balls. Getting a seat on the train. The nurse smiling at me in the hallway. These weren't happiness—happiness was too big, too complicated—but they were moments when the weight lifted, just a little, and I could breathe.",
      `The hospital had a chapel. A small room with stained glass and uncomfortable pews and a sign that said "All Faiths Welcome." I went there sometimes, not because I believed in God—I didn't know what I believed anymore—but because it was quiet. Quiet was rare in my life, and I took it wherever I could find it.`,
      "I stopped making plans beyond the immediate future. I didn't plan for next week or next month or next year. I planned for today. Today I would go to work. Today I would visit Yuna. Today I would survive. Tomorrow would take care of itself, or it wouldn't. Either way, I couldn't control it, so I stopped trying.",
      "I learned the nurses' schedules. Which ones worked days, which ones worked nights, which ones were kind, which ones were efficient. I timed my visits to coincide with the kind ones, not because the efficient ones were bad—they weren't—but because I needed kindness, even if it was professional kindness, even if it was just part of the job.",
      "The hospital had a cafeteria. I ate there sometimes when I was too tired to cook, sitting at a table by myself, surrounded by other people who were eating alone. We were a community of solitude, bound together by grief and illness and the understanding that some things you had to face alone.",
      "I brought Yuna music. Her favorite songs, downloaded onto my phone, played through tiny speakers that barely filled the room. I didn't know if she could hear it. The doctors said there was no evidence either way. But I played it anyway, because it was something I could do, something active, something that felt like love.",
      "The hospital had a garden. A small patch of grass behind the building where patients and visitors could sit and breathe air that didn't smell like antiseptic. I went there sometimes, when the weather was nice, and I'd sit on a bench and watch the bees move between flowers. It was peaceful. It was the closest thing to normal I had.",
      "I learned to read the monitors. The beeps and the numbers and the flashing lights. I could tell when Yuna's heart rate was normal, when her blood pressure was stable, when something needed attention. I became fluent in the language of her survival, and that was both a comfort and a curse.",
      `The hospital had a chapel. A small room with stained glass and uncomfortable pews and a sign that said "All Faiths Welcome." I went there sometimes, not because I believed in God—I didn't know what I believed anymore—but because it was quiet. Quiet was rare in my life, and I took it wherever I could find it.`,
      "I kept a record of everything. Her vitals, her medications, the doctors' visits, the small changes that might or might not mean something. I wrote it all down in a notebook, page after page of data about a girl who wasn't there. It was obsessive, maybe, but it was something I could control, and control was what I needed.",
      "The hospital had a support group for families of coma patients. I went once, sat in a circle of chairs, listened to people tell stories that were too familiar. I never went back. It wasn't that they weren't helpful—they were—but that hearing other people's pain didn't make mine any better. It just made it louder.",
      "I learned to recognize the sounds of Yuna's room. The beep of the monitor. The hiss of the ventilator. The hum of the machines. These sounds became familiar, comforting in their way. They were the sounds of her life, the soundtrack of her survival, and I knew them better than I knew anything else.",
      "The hospital had a policy about personal items. Patients could have things from home, within reason. I brought Yuna's things—her books, her clothes, her stuffed animals—and arranged them around the room like I was building a nest. It was stupid, but it made me feel like I was doing something, like I was making her comfortable, like I was being a good brother.",
      "I stopped crying after a while. Not because I didn't feel sad—I did, constantly—but because crying took energy I couldn't spare. I needed that energy for work, for the hospital, for surviving. So I stopped crying, and the sadness settled into my chest like a heavy stone, and I carried it everywhere I went.",
      "The hospital had a volunteer program. People who came in to read to patients, to sit with them, to provide human contact when family couldn't be there. I appreciated them, really I did, but I never let them sit with Yuna. That was my job. That was the only thing I had left, and I wasn't going to share it.",
      "I learned to sleep in the chair. Not well—my back always hurt, my neck always cramped—but enough to get through the night. Sometimes I stayed overnight when the nurses said she was having a bad night, when the monitors beeped more often, when something felt wrong. I slept in the chair and held her hand and waited for morning.",
      "The hospital had a gift shop. I bought things there sometimes—flowers, cards, small stuffed animals. I put them in Yuna's room, on the windowsill, on the nightstand, anywhere there was space. The room was full of things I'd bought, evidence of my love in physical form. It wasn't enough. It was never enough.",
      "I stopped making plans. Not just big plans—college, career, the future—but small plans too. What to eat for dinner. When to do laundry. What to watch on television. I lived moment to moment, responding to whatever happened next, because planning required hope and I didn't have any hope left.",
      "My parents weren't perfect. They fought sometimes, about money and work and the usual things couples fight about. But they always made up. Always. Dad would bring Mom flowers, or Mom would make Dad's favorite dinner, or they'd just sit on the couch and hold hands until the anger faded away. They loved each other, and that love was stronger than anything that could come between them.",
      "Dad had a workshop in the garage. He wasn't a handyman by trade, but he liked fixing things. He fixed the toaster when it stopped working. He fixed Yuna's bicycle when the chain fell off. He fixed the kitchen table when it wobbled. He said fixing things was satisfying because broken things stayed broken unless someone fixed them, and someone had to be that someone. Now the garage is full of tools I don't know how to use and projects I don't know how to finish.",
      "Mom was the one who handled the money. Dad earned it, but Mom managed it—paid the bills, balanced the checkbook, made sure there was enough for everything we needed. She was good at it, methodical and organized, and she taught me to be good at it too. Now I handle the money alone, and I'm not as good at it as she was. I make mistakes. I forget things. I miss her.",
      "Dad had a favorite chair. An old armchair in the living room, worn and comfortable, with a permanent indentation where he sat. He'd read there, watch television there, nap there. It was his spot, his territory, and no one else sat there unless he invited them to. After he died, I couldn't bring myself to sit in it. It felt like trespassing. It still does.",
      `Mom used to sing while she cooked. Not well—she couldn't carry a tune in a bucket—but with enthusiasm, like singing was something that had to be done with full commitment. She sang old Japanese songs and American pop songs and made-up songs about whatever she was cooking. "Rice is nice," she'd sing, "rice is nice, rice is very very nice." I haven't heard anyone sing in the kitchen since she died. The kitchen is too quiet now.`,
      "My parents had friends. Not a lot—Dad was too quiet for a big social circle, Mom was too busy—but a few close ones, people they'd known for years, people who came to dinner parties and barbecues and birthday celebrations. After the funeral, those friends reached out, offered help, said to call if I needed anything. I never called. I couldn't. It was too hard to see people who knew them as people, not just as memories.",
      "Dad was proud of me. Not in a loud, boastful way, but in a quiet, steady way that I could feel even when he didn't say anything. He came to my school events, he helped me with homework, he listened when I talked about things that interested me. He made me feel like I mattered, like I was worth his time and attention. Now there's no one to be proud of me, and I don't know if I matter at all.",
      "Mom worried about everything. About money, about our health, about the future, about things that might never happen. Dad called her a worrywart and told her to relax, but she couldn't. Worrying was how she showed love—by anticipating problems before they happened, by trying to protect us from things that might go wrong. I inherited her worrying. I worry about everything now, just like she did.",
      "My parents had a routine. Wake up, coffee, work, dinner, television, sleep. Weekends were for chores and errands and family time. It wasn't exciting, but it was stable, predictable, safe. I took it for granted. I thought that's how life was supposed to be—stable, predictable, safe. Now I know better. Now I know that stability is a luxury, and safety is an illusion.",
      "Dad taught me to drive. Not well—he was impatient and I was nervous and we both yelled more than we should have—but he taught me. He sat in the passenger seat and gripped the dashboard and told me to watch the road and check my mirrors and use my turn signal, and eventually I learned. I still have his car. I still drive it sometimes. It smells like him, faint but unmistakable, and every time I get in, I miss him all over again.",
      "I learned to budget the way soldiers learn to field-strip weapons—through repetition, necessity, and the understanding that failure had consequences. Every dollar was assigned a purpose before it arrived. Rent: first priority. Hospital: second. Food: third. Everything else: nonexistent. I hadn't bought new clothes in a year. My shoes had holes that I covered with duct tape. My phone was two generations old and held together by a cracked screen protector and stubbornness.",
      "The apartment was a constant reminder of what I'd lost. Dad's tools in the garage. Mom's books on the shelves. Yuna's room, exactly as she'd left it, with schoolbooks on the desk and clothes on the floor and posters on the walls. I couldn't bring myself to change anything. It felt like erasing them, like admitting they weren't coming back. So I lived in this museum of their lives, surrounded by ghosts, and I pretended it was home.",
      "I stopped sleeping. Not entirely—I still closed my eyes and lay in the dark for hours—but I stopped actually sleeping, the kind of deep restorative sleep that makes you feel like a person. Instead I drifted in a haze of exhaustion, awake enough to function but not enough to feel, and that was fine. Feeling was the problem. If I didn't sleep, I didn't dream, and if I didn't dream, I didn't have to wake up and remember that they were gone.",
      "I developed a system for everything. A system for laundry (Sundays). A system for grocery shopping (Tuesdays). A system for paying bills (Fridays). Systems were predictable. Systems didn't require decisions. Systems were the opposite of chaos, and chaos was what I was trying to avoid.",

The old woman who brought knitting and never finished anything. I watched them like they were characters in a show, and for a while, I wasn't the only one who was lonely.",
      "I learned to fix things. Not well—YouTube tutorials and trial and error—but enough to keep things working. The leaky faucet. The broken drawer. The flickering light. Dad would have been proud. Or maybe he would have been sad that I had to learn these things alone. I didn't know. I never asked.",
      "I stopped making plans. Not just big plans—college, career, the future—but small plans too. What to eat for dinner. When to do laundry. What to watch on television. I lived moment to moment, responding to whatever happened next, because planning required hope and I didn't have any hope left.",
      "The anger faded eventually. Not all at once, but slowly, like a wound that stops hurting even though the scar remains. I still got angry sometimes—at the unfairness, at the waste, at the silence—but it wasn't the constant burning rage it had been. It was just another feeling, another weight to carry, and I carried it because I had to.",
      `Everyone I knew was playing. Coworkers, neighbors, people on the train. Even the nurses at the hospital talked about it during their breaks. "What class are you playing?" they'd ask each other. "What server are you on?" "Have you tried the new dungeon?" It was like a secret language, and I didn't speak it. I was the only person not playing, and that made me feel more alone than ever.`,
      "The game had classes and races and skills and levels and all the trappings of traditional MMORPGs, but with a level of depth and complexity that made previous games look like toys. You could be a warrior or a mage or a rogue, but you could also be a craftsman or a merchant or a politician. You could build cities, run guilds, influence economies. The possibilities were literally endless, or so they said.",
      "I watched videos of gameplay. Streams of people exploring vast landscapes, fighting epic monsters, casting spectacular spells. It looked beautiful. It looked exciting. It looked like everything my life wasn't. And for a moment, just a moment, I felt something that felt almost like desire. Then I remembered Yuna in the hospital, and the feeling vanished, replaced by guilt. How could I want to play a game when my sister was in a coma?",
      "The game had a story. A main quest line that promised hundreds of hours of content. Side quests that would take months to complete. Hidden secrets and easter eggs and lore that players were still discovering. People spent hours discussing theories and sharing discoveries and debating the meaning of it all. It was a world within a world, and I was outside both of them.",
      "The social aspect was the biggest draw. You could meet people from all over the world. Form parties, join guilds, make friends, fall in love. People were getting married in the game. People were building real relationships that started in a virtual world. It was like the game had become a new kind of reality, one that was more real than the old one for millions of people.",
      "I tried to ignore it. I really did. I focused on work, on the hospital, on surviving. But the game was everywhere. It was inescapable. And slowly, almost without noticing, I started paying attention. I started reading articles about it. I started watching streams. I started wondering what it would be like to step into that world, to leave this one behind, if only for a little while.",
      "The game had a reputation system. Your actions had consequences. If you helped people, you gained reputation. If you hurt people, you lost it. Your reputation affected how NPCs treated you, what quests you could access, even what areas of the world you could enter. It was a moral system, but not a simple one. There were shades of gray, difficult choices, consequences that rippled through the world. It was complicated, and I liked complicated.",
      "The economy was player-driven. Everything in the game was crafted or gathered or sold by players. There were no NPCs selling items—everything came from other players. This meant the economy was complex and dynamic and constantly changing. Prices fluctuated based on supply and demand. Fortunes were made and lost. It was like a real economy, but without the real-world consequences. Or so people said.",
      "I heard stories about people who'd changed their lives through the game. People who'd made real money by selling in-game items. People who'd found real friends, real communities, real purpose. People who'd escaped abusive situations or found treatment for depression or discovered parts of themselves they didn't know existed. The game was more than entertainment—it was a lifeline for some people. I wondered if it could be a lifeline for me too.",
      "The game had been in development for ten years. A team of hundreds of developers, working in secret, creating something unprecedented. The technology alone was revolutionary—a neural interface that could read and write to the brain with near-zero latency. But it wasn't just the technology. It was the world they'd built. The depth, the detail, the sheer scale of it. It was a masterpiece, and everyone knew it.",
      "I thought about what Dad would want. He'd bought this for me. He'd spent money he could have used for something else. He'd planned this, whatever this was. If I didn't use it, I was wasting his gift. I was disrespecting his memory. But if I did use it, I was escaping into a virtual world while my sister lay in a coma in the real one. Either way, I was betraying someone. Either way, I was doing it wrong.",
      "The game promised escape. That was its selling point. A world where you could be anyone, do anything, leave your problems behind. But I didn't want to escape. I wanted to fix things. I wanted to wake Yuna up. I wanted to bring Mom and Dad back. I wanted to undo the accident. The game couldn't do any of that. The game was just a distraction, a way to pretend that everything was fine when it wasn't.",
      "I researched the game obsessively. I read every article, watched every video, followed every discussion thread. I learned about the classes and the races and the skills and the world. I learned about the economy and the politics and the social systems. I learned everything there was to know, except what it felt like to actually play. That was the one thing I couldn't learn without logging in.",
      "The headset had a neural interface. That was the revolutionary part. It connected directly to your brain, reading your thoughts and translating them into game actions. No controllers, no keyboards, no buttons. You thought about moving, and you moved. You thought about casting a spell, and you cast it. It was supposed to be seamless, intuitive, like using your own body. The idea terrified me.",
      "I worried about the risks. What if something went wrong? What if the interface damaged my brain? What if I got stuck in the game? What if I couldn't log out? The developers said it was safe, that they'd tested it extensively, that millions of people were using it without problems. But developers always said that. They always said their products were safe until they weren't.",
      "I thought about Yuna. What would she think if she knew I was playing a game while she lay in a hospital bed? She'd probably make fun of me. She'd probably say I was being a nerd. She'd probably want to play too. The thought made me smile, just a little, and then it made me sad, because she couldn't play. She couldn't do anything. She was just lying there, and I was here, hesitating over a headset.",
      "The headset was a bridge. Between me and Dad, between the real world and the virtual one, between who I was and who I might become. I didn't know if I wanted to cross that bridge. I didn't know what was on the other side. But the bridge was there, and eventually, I knew I'd have to decide whether to walk across it or turn away.",
      "I remembered Dad's voice. Not the exact words, but the tone. The way he sounded when he was proud of me, when he was worried about me, when he was trying to tell me something without actually saying it. He'd bought this headset for a reason. He'd wanted me to have it for a reason. I didn't know what the reason was, but I trusted him. I trusted that whatever he'd been thinking, whatever he'd been feeling, it had come from love.",

It felt finite, limited, bounded by grief and responsibility and the crushing weight of survival. The game offered something my life didn't: a future. A future that wasn't just more of the same.",

      "Yuna was fourteen when the accident happened. Fourteen years old, with braces she hated and a laugh that could fill a room like sunlight fills a window—completely, effortlessly, without trying. She'd been in the backseat. Mom and Dad were in the front. The truck ran a red light at fifty miles per hour, and in the space between one heartbeat and the next, my family went from four people to one and a half.",
      "The hospital called at 11:47 PM on a Tuesday. I remember the exact time because I was watching the clock on my phone, waiting for a text from Yuna about whether she wanted me to pick her up from her friend's house. The text never came. The call did. And the voice on the other end used words like 'accident' and 'critical condition' and 'you should come now' in a tone that was professionally calm and personally devastating.",
      "Room 414 became the center of my universe. Not by choice—nothing about this was by choice—but by gravity. Yuna lay in the bed with tubes and wires connecting her to machines that beeped and hummed and breathed for her, and I sat in the chair beside her and tried to remember what her voice sounded like when it wasn't trapped inside a body that had forgotten how to wake up.",
      "Before the accident, Yuna was the loud one. The brave one. The one who climbed trees and argued with teachers and declared, at age seven, that she was going to be an astronaut-chef who cooked meals in zero gravity. She had plans. She had opinions about everything. She had a future that stretched out in front of her like an open road. Now she had a hospital bed and a brother who visited every day and a prognosis that doctors delivered with carefully managed expectations.",
      "Yuna's room was full of things that used to matter. Her schoolbooks, still open to the page she'd been reading when the accident happened. Her phone, with unanswered messages from friends who didn't know yet. Her clothes, hanging in the closet she'd never use again. These were the artifacts of a life that had stopped, frozen in time like a photograph, and every time I saw them, I felt the loss all over again.",
      "The doctors called it a persistent vegetative state. They used words like 'brain activity' and 'neural responses' and 'probability of recovery' with the careful precision of people who'd learned that hope was a dangerous thing to give. They showed me brain scans and explained what the colors meant and told me that time was the only treatment, and time was something we had too much of and not enough of, all at once.",
      "I remember Yuna's laugh. Not the sound of it exactly, though I remember that too—bright and sudden and impossible to fake—but the feeling of it. The way it made me feel like everything was going to be okay, even when it wasn't. The way it filled up empty spaces and pushed back the darkness. I haven't heard that laugh in two years, and sometimes I think I'll never hear anything like it again.",
      "Yuna was the brave one. Not brave like soldiers or firefighters, but brave in the way that only teenage girls can be—brave about small things that felt huge, brave about dreams that seemed impossible, brave about wearing her heart on her sleeve even when she knew it might get broken. She was brave about everything except the accident, and the accident was the one thing that required bravery, and she wasn't there to be brave.",
      "The last time I saw Yuna awake was the morning of the accident. She was running late for school, as usual, and I was making breakfast, as usual. She grabbed a piece of toast and yelled 'see you later' and ran out the door, and I yelled 'be careful' and she yelled 'I'm always careful' and that was it. That was our last conversation. 'See you later' and 'be careful' and 'I'm always careful.' If I'd known it was the last time, I would have said something else. I would have said everything.",
      "Yuna's hands were small and soft and always moving. She talked with her hands, gesturing and pointing and waving, like she was conducting an orchestra of her own thoughts. I held those hands now, in the hospital, and they were still small and soft but they didn't move. They lay still on the sheets, and I tried to remember what they felt like when they were alive, when they were part of a person who was awake and present and real."

      "I read to her every visit. Sometimes novels—she'd been halfway through a fantasy series when the accident happened, and I finished it for her, then started the next one. Sometimes news articles, because she'd always been curious about the world. Sometimes I just talked. About my day, about the weather, about the weird guy at work who ate sardines for breakfast. Mundane things. Human things. The kind of things you share with someone you love, even when you're not sure they can hear you.",
      "The doctors used the word 'coma' like it was a place—somewhere Yuna had gone, a room she'd locked herself in. They talked about brain activity and neural responses and the difference between persistent and permanent with the careful precision of people who'd learned that hope was a medicine they couldn't prescribe but couldn't withhold either. I listened to every word. I researched every term. I became an expert in a field I never wanted to study.",
      "Her hand was always warm. That was the thing that kept me coming back, beyond love, beyond obligation, beyond the stubborn refusal to accept that this was permanent. Her hand was warm. Living. Present. Whatever had happened to her brain, her body was still here, still fighting, still maintaining a temperature that said 'I'm alive' in the most fundamental language biology knows. I held that hand and I believed in it.",
      "The bills came monthly. ICU care, specialist consultations, physical therapy to prevent muscle atrophy, medications I couldn't pronounce for conditions I barely understood. Each envelope was a small violence—a reminder that love wasn't enough, that keeping someone alive required money I didn't have in quantities that felt designed to break me. I worked overtime. I sold things. I ate less. I did the math every night and the math never worked, but I made it work anyway, because the alternative was unthinkable.",
      "Sometimes I dreamed about her waking up. Not the dramatic movie version—eyes flying open, gasping for breath, immediately asking what happened. The real version. Slow. Confused. A flutter of eyelids. A twitch of fingers. A sound that might be a word or might be nothing. In the dream, I was always there. Always holding her hand. Always the first thing she saw. I'd wake up from those dreams with wet cheeks and a chest that felt like it had been opened and closed without anesthesia.",
      "Yuna's room had a window that faced east. Every morning, sunlight crept across the floor and climbed the bed and touched her face, and for a few minutes she looked like she was just sleeping. Just a girl, sleeping late on a weekend, about to wake up and complain about breakfast. Those minutes were the closest thing to peace I had. Then the machines would beep, and a nurse would come in, and the illusion would dissolve like sugar in rain.",
      "I talked to her about everything. About the warehouse, about the train rides, about the convenience store clerk who always gave me extra rice balls. About the weather, about the news, about things I'd seen on my walk to the hospital. I talked because silence was too heavy and because I needed to believe that somewhere, somehow, she could hear me. The doctors said there was no evidence of consciousness, but the doctors also said there was no evidence that she couldn't hear, and I chose to believe in the possibility.",
      "The nurses knew me by name. They knew my schedule, they knew my routine, they knew which chair I preferred and which vending machine had the least terrible coffee. They were kind to me, in the professional way that nurses are kind to people who spend too much time in hospitals. They asked how I was doing and I said fine and they nodded like they believed me, though we both knew I was lying.",
      "I brought her things. Flowers, though the nurses said they weren't allowed. Books, though she couldn't read them. Music, though she couldn't hear it. I brought her things because bringing things was something I could do, something active, something that felt like helping even when it wasn't. It was better than sitting in the chair and holding her hand and feeling helpless.",
      "Sometimes I got angry. Not at Yuna—never at Yuna—but at the situation, at the universe, at the unfairness of it all. Yuna was fourteen. She had her whole life ahead of her. She was supposed to graduate high school and go to college and fall in love and make mistakes and have adventures. She wasn't supposed to be in a hospital bed, connected to machines, while her brother sat beside her and tried to remember what her laugh sounded like.",
      "I kept a journal. Not a diary—diaries were for people with feelings worth recording—but a log. A record of her vitals, of the doctors' visits, of the medications they gave her, of the small changes that might or might not mean something. I wrote it all down because writing it down made it real, and making it real made it manageable, and making it manageable was the only way I could survive it.",
      "The other patients in the ward came and went. Some got better and went home. Some got worse and went to the ICU. Some died. I watched them all with a kind of detached fascination, like I was watching a nature documentary about survival. Yuna stayed the same. Day after day, week after week, month after month. She stayed the same, and I stayed the same, and the world moved on without us.",
      "I learned the language of the machines. The beep that meant her heart rate was normal. The hiss that meant the ventilator was working. The flash that meant something needed attention. I could read the monitors without looking at the numbers, just by the rhythm of the sounds and lights. I became fluent in a language I never wanted to learn.",
      "Sometimes I imagined what Yuna would say if she could see me now. She'd probably make fun of my hair, which I hadn't cut in months. She'd probably tell me to get a life, which was rich coming from someone in a coma. She'd probably say something that was both mean and kind, because that was how she was, and I would give anything to hear her say it.",
      "The hardest part wasn't the sadness or the grief or the fear. The hardest part was the not knowing. Not knowing if she could hear me. Not knowing if she was in pain. Not knowing if she would ever wake up. Not knowing if I was doing the right thing by keeping her alive, or if I was just being selfish. Not knowing anything, except that I loved her and I couldn't let her go."

I never learned the name of the song. I'd give anything to hear it again.",
      "Dad was an engineer. The quiet kind—not the Silicon Valley type with hoodies and stock options, but the kind who designed bridges and water systems and infrastructure that people used every day without knowing his name. He had hands that were always slightly calloused and a mind that saw the world in load-bearing structures and stress tolerances. He built things that lasted. Except, apparently, himself.",
      "They told me my parents died in the crash. The police, the hospital, the social worker who appeared with a clipboard and an expression that had been trained to convey sympathy without attachment. Dead on impact, they said. Instantaneous. No suffering. As if the speed of death was a consolation. As if 'at least it was quick' could fill the space where two people used to be.",
      "I was eighteen when they died. Old enough to be legally responsible for myself and my sister. Young enough that the weight of it nearly crushed me. One day I was a high school senior worrying about college applications and whether Yuna had done her homework. The next day I was an orphan with a comatose sister and a stack of paperwork that treated the worst day of my life as an administrative event.",
      "My parents were ordinary people. They weren't heroes or villains or anyone remarkable. They were just Mom and Dad, with ordinary jobs and ordinary worries and ordinary lives. They paid their bills on time and voted in elections and worried about their kids and loved each other in the quiet, unremarkable way that ordinary people do. And then they were gone, and the world kept turning like nothing had happened.",
      "The last time I saw my parents was the morning of the accident. Dad was leaving for work and Mom was making breakfast and Yuna was running late for school, as usual. 'Have a good day,' Dad said. 'Don't forget your lunch,' Mom said. 'See you later,' Yuna said. 'See you later,' I said. And that was it. That was our last conversation. Three sentences, spoken in the ordinary rush of an ordinary morning, and I didn't know they were the last words I would ever say to them."

      "Dad taught me to cook. Not well—his repertoire was limited to about six dishes, all of them involving rice—but with patience and a methodical approach that turned every meal into a small engineering project. 'Measure twice, cut once,' he'd say, which was a construction phrase, not a cooking one, but it worked for both. I still made his curry recipe every Sunday. It never tasted the same. Close, but not the same. The missing ingredient was him standing beside me, correcting my knife technique.",
      "Mom had a way of knowing things before you said them. Not psychic—practical. She read people the way she read languages: fluently, instinctively, catching the subtext beneath the text. She knew when I was lying about homework. She knew when Yuna was scared but pretending to be brave. She knew when Dad was stressed about a project before he'd said a word. I inherited her observational skills but not her warmth. I could read people. I just couldn't reach them the way she could.",
      "The last conversation I had with my father was about a leaky faucet. He'd promised to fix it that weekend. 'Saturday,' he said, 'after I drop your sister off at her friend's house.' Saturday never came. The faucet leaked for another month before I figured out how to fix it myself, following a YouTube tutorial with tears running down my face because the wrench kept slipping and Dad would have done it in five minutes and I couldn't even do this one simple thing without him.",
      "There were things about my parents that didn't add up, but I was too young and too grief-stricken to notice at the time. The way Dad sometimes received phone calls he took in another room. The way Mom's translation work occasionally required her to travel to places that didn't seem to need translators. The locked drawer in Dad's desk that I'd never been allowed to open. Small things. Ordinary things, probably. But they accumulated in my memory like sediment, and sometimes, late at night, I wondered what picture they'd form if I ever brushed away the dust.",
      "I kept their wedding photo on my nightstand. Mom in a simple white dress, Dad in a suit that was slightly too big in the shoulders, both of them looking at each other instead of the camera. The photographer had captured something private—a look that said 'you're the only person in this room' even though the room was full of guests. I studied that photo sometimes, trying to decode the people they'd been before they became my parents. Before they became memories. Before they became questions I couldn't answer.",
      "The funeral was on a Thursday. It rained. I wore Dad's suit—the one from the wedding photo, which fit me better than it had fit him—and I stood between two coffins and tried to feel something appropriate. Grief, sadness, anger at the truck driver, anger at God, anger at the universe for its casual cruelty. What I actually felt was numb. Completely, thoroughly, medically numb. The feelings came later, in waves, over months, each one arriving without warning and leaving without resolution.",
      "Mom used to sing while she cooked. Not well—she couldn't carry a tune in a bucket—but with enthusiasm, like singing was something that had to be done with full commitment. She sang old Japanese songs and American pop songs and made-up songs about whatever she was cooking. 'Rice is nice,' she'd sing, 'rice is nice, rice is very very nice.' I haven't heard anyone sing in the kitchen since she died. The kitchen is too quiet now.",
      "Dad had a workshop in the garage. He wasn't a handyman by trade, but he liked fixing things. He fixed the toaster when it stopped working. He fixed Yuna's bicycle when the chain fell off. He fixed the kitchen table when it wobbled. He said fixing things was satisfying because broken things stayed broken unless someone fixed them, and someone had to be that someone. Now the garage is full of tools I don't know how to use and projects I don't know how to finish.",
      "My parents met in college. Mom was studying languages, Dad was studying engineering, and they met in a cafeteria line when Mom dropped her tray and Dad helped her pick it up. They used to tell that story at dinner parties, laughing about how romantic it wasn't. 'It was just a tray,' Mom would say. 'It was a very nice tray,' Dad would say, and they'd smile at each other like they were sharing a secret. I don't know what the secret was. I never asked. Now I'll never know.",
      "After they died, I had to go through their things. Their clothes, their books, their papers, their photos. It felt like violating their privacy, like I was seeing parts of them they'd never meant anyone to see. But I had to do it. I had to sort through the evidence of their lives and decide what to keep and what to throw away and what to donate, and every decision felt like a betrayal, even though I knew it wasn't.",
      "Sometimes I forget what they sounded like. I remember that Mom's voice was soft and Dad's voice was deep, but the exact quality of their voices—the way Mom said my name, the way Dad laughed—those details are fading. I try to hold onto them, but memories are slippery things, and the more I try to grasp them, the faster they slip away. I'm afraid that one day I'll wake up and I won't remember them at all.",
      "My parents weren't perfect people. They had flaws and they made mistakes and they had fights, just like everyone else. But they loved us. They loved Yuna and they loved me, and they loved each other, and that love was the foundation of everything. Now the foundation is gone and I'm building a life on top of nothing, and I don't know how to do that. I don't know how to be a person without parents to show me how."

There was no gradual introduction, no shallow end, no instructor standing by with a flotation device. One day I had parents and a home and a future that someone else was responsible for shaping. The next day I had bills and a lease and a sister in the ICU and the terrifying realization that no one was coming to help.",
      "The first month was the worst. Not because of the grief—the grief was constant, a background radiation that colored everything—but because of the logistics. Insurance forms. Hospital paperwork. Funeral costs. The apartment lease that was in Dad's name. The utilities. The bank accounts that required death certificates to access. Grief was emotional. This was mechanical. And the machine didn't care that I was eighteen and terrified.",

The acceptance letter from the university sat on my desk for two weeks before I called the admissions office and explained, in a voice that was steadier than I felt, that my circumstances had changed. The woman on the phone was kind. She said I could defer for a year. I said thank you and hung up and never called back. A year wasn't going to fix this. Nothing was going to fix this. I needed a job, not a degree.",

Twelve-hour shifts, overnight, loading trucks with crates that weighed more than my future. The pay was fifteen dollars an hour, which sounded like a lot until you divided it by hospital bills and rent and food and the thousand small expenses that turned survival into a full-time accounting job.",

I didn't know how insurance worked or what a deductible was or why medical bills were so incomprehensible. I learned by making mistakes and paying for them, literally and figuratively, and every mistake felt like proof that I wasn't ready for this, that I was failing at the most basic task of being alive.",

I took the list and I thanked her and I never called any of them. I didn't have time for support groups or counseling.

Every dollar was assigned a purpose before it arrived. Rent: first priority. Hospital: second. Food: third. Everything else: nonexistent. I hadn't bought new clothes in a year. My shoes had holes that I covered with duct tape. My phone was two generations old and held together by a cracked screen protector and stubbornness.",

Yuna's room, exactly as she'd left it, with schoolbooks on the desk and clothes on the floor and posters on the walls. I couldn't bring myself to change anything. It felt like erasing them, like admitting they weren't coming back. So I lived in this museum of their lives, surrounded by ghosts, and I pretended it was home.",
      "I stopped sleeping. Not entirely—I still closed my eyes and lay in the dark for hours—but I stopped actually sleeping, the kind of deep restorative sleep that makes you feel like a person. Instead I drifted in a haze of exhaustion, awake enough to function but not enough to feel, and that was fine. Feeling was the problem. If I didn't sleep, I didn't dream, and if I didn't dream, I didn't have to wake up and remember that they were gone.",
      "The loneliness was physical. It was a weight in my chest, a tightness in my throat, a hollow ache behind my eyes. I was surrounded by people—at work, on the train, in the hospital—but I was completely alone. No one knew what I was going through. No one could know. Grief is a solitary experience, even when you're surrounded by people who love you, and I didn't even have that. I had coworkers and nurses and strangers, and none of them could help.",
      "I developed rituals. Not religious rituals—I wasn't praying to anyone—but personal ones, small acts of order in a chaotic world. I made coffee the same way every morning. I visited Yuna at the same time every day. I walked the same route to the warehouse. These rituals were anchors, things I could hold onto when everything else felt like it was spinning away.",
      "There were moments when I almost broke. Moments when the weight was too heavy and the loneliness was too sharp and the future was too dark, and I wanted to just stop. Stop working, stop paying bills, stop visiting the hospital, stop everything. But I didn't. I couldn't. Yuna was still alive, and as long as she was alive, I had to keep going. That was the deal. That was the only thing keeping me moving.",
      "I learned to be invisible. At work, I did my job without drawing attention to myself. On the train, I blended into the crowd. In the hospital, I was just another visitor in a sea of visitors. Being invisible was safer. Being invisible meant no one asked questions. Being invisible meant I could just exist, without expectations or obligations or the need to perform for other people.",
      "The anger came later. Not at first—at first there was just shock and grief and the overwhelming need to survive. But after the shock faded and the grief settled into something manageable, the anger came. Anger at the truck driver who ran the red light. Anger at the hospital for being so expensive. Anger at the universe for being so unfair. Anger at my parents for leaving me. Anger at myself for not being able to fix any of it.",
      "I stopped caring about the future. The future was a concept that belonged to a different version of me, a version who had parents and a sister who was awake and a life that made sense. That version was gone. The present was all I had, and the present was just surviving, just getting through one day so I could get through the next. So I stopped planning. I stopped dreaming. I stopped hoping. I just existed.",
      "The hardest part was the small things. The way the apartment was too quiet. The way no one asked how my day was. The way I had to make all the decisions alone, even the small ones like what to eat for dinner or when to go to bed. These small things accumulated, day after day, until they felt like a weight I couldn't carry.",
      "I became good at pretending. Pretending I was fine. Pretending I knew what I was doing. Pretending I had everything under control. I pretended so well that sometimes I almost believed it myself. But then I'd come home to an empty apartment or sit alone in a hospital room or wake up in the middle of the night with no one to call, and the pretending would crack, and underneath was the truth: I was drowning, and I didn't know how to swim."

      "I watched videos of gameplay. Streams of people exploring vast landscapes, fighting epic monsters, casting spectacular spells. It looked beautiful. It looked exciting. It looked like everything my life wasn't. And for a moment, just a moment, I felt something that felt almost like desire. Then I remembered Yuna in the hospital, and the feeling vanished, replaced by guilt. How could I want to play a game when my sister was in a coma?",
      "The game had a story. A main quest line that promised hundreds of hours of content. Side quests that would take months to complete. Hidden secrets and easter eggs and lore that players were still discovering. People spent hours discussing theories and sharing discoveries and debating the meaning of it all. It was a world within a world, and I was outside both of them.",
      "The social aspect was the biggest draw. You could meet people from all over the world. Form parties, join guilds, make friends, fall in love. People were getting married in the game. People were building real relationships that started in a virtual world. It was like the game had become a new kind of reality, one that was more real than the old one for millions of people.",
      "I tried to ignore it. I really did. I focused on work, on the hospital, on surviving. But the game was everywhere. It was inescapable. And slowly, almost without noticing, I started paying attention. I started reading articles about it. I started watching streams. I started wondering what it would be like to step into that world, to leave this one behind, if only for a little while.",
      "The game had a reputation system. Your actions had consequences. If you helped people, you gained reputation. If you hurt people, you lost it. Your reputation affected how NPCs treated you, what quests you could access, even what areas of the world you could enter. It was a moral system, but not a simple one. There were shades of gray, difficult choices, consequences that rippled through the world. It was complicated, and I liked complicated.",
      "The economy was player-driven. Everything in the game was crafted or gathered or sold by players. There were no NPCs selling items—everything came from other players. This meant the economy was complex and dynamic and constantly changing. Prices fluctuated based on supply and demand. Fortunes were made and lost. It was like a real economy, but without the real-world consequences. Or so people said.",
      "I heard stories about people who'd changed their lives through the game. People who'd made real money by selling in-game items. People who'd found real friends, real communities, real purpose. People who'd escaped abusive situations or found treatment for depression or discovered parts of themselves they didn't know existed. The game was more than entertainment—it was a lifeline for some people. I wondered if it could be a lifeline for me too.",
      "The game had been in development for ten years. A team of hundreds of developers, working in secret, creating something unprecedented. The technology alone was revolutionary—a neural interface that could read and write to the brain with near-zero latency. But it wasn't just the technology. It was the world they'd built. The depth, the detail, the sheer scale of it. It was a masterpiece, and everyone knew it."

      "I found the headset in a box of Dad's things. I was going through his workshop, sorting through tools and projects I didn't understand, and there it was—wrapped in bubble wrap, tucked in the back of a drawer. No note, no explanation, just the headset and a receipt dated three months before the accident. He'd bought it for me. He'd bought it and never told me, and now he was gone and I'd never know why.",
      "The headset was expensive. I looked it up online—five hundred dollars, plus tax, plus shipping. Dad had paid for overnight delivery. He'd wanted me to have it on launch day. He'd wanted me to be part of whatever this was. But he'd never given it to me. Maybe he was waiting for my birthday. Maybe he was waiting for the right moment. Maybe he'd just forgotten. I'd never know.",
      "I almost threw it away. That was my first instinct. I didn't want it. I didn't want anything that reminded me of Dad, of the accident, of the life we used to have. But I couldn't bring myself to do it. It was the last thing he'd ever bought for me. Throwing it away felt like throwing him away, like erasing the last piece of evidence that he'd existed, that he'd loved me.",
      "The headset sat on my desk for weeks. I looked at it every day, but I didn't touch it. It was like a bomb that might go off if I handled it wrong. A bomb made of grief and guilt and questions I couldn't answer. What did Dad want me to do with it? Why did he buy it? What was he trying to tell me? I didn't know. I didn't know anything anymore.",
      "I finally opened the box on a Tuesday night. I don't know why Tuesday. I don't know why that night. Maybe I was just tired of looking at it. Maybe I was just tired of wondering. I opened the box and took out the headset and it was heavier than I expected, sleek and black and impossibly advanced, like something from a science fiction movie.",
      "The instructions were simple. Put on the headset. Connect to your phone. Follow the on-screen prompts. That was it. No setup, no configuration, no technical knowledge required. The technology was designed to be accessible to everyone, from gamers to grandmothers. I read the instructions three times, then put the headset back in the box. I wasn't ready. I didn't know if I'd ever be ready."

      "I thought about what Dad would want. He'd bought this for me. He'd spent money he could have used for something else. He'd planned this, whatever this was. If I didn't use it, I was wasting his gift. I was disrespecting his memory. But if I did use it, I was escaping into a virtual world while my sister lay in a coma in the real one. Either way, I was betraying someone. Either way, I was doing it wrong.",
      "The game promised escape. That was its selling point. A world where you could be anyone, do anything, leave your problems behind. But I didn't want to escape. I wanted to fix things. I wanted to wake Yuna up. I wanted to bring Mom and Dad back. I wanted to undo the accident. The game couldn't do any of that. The game was just a distraction, a way to pretend that everything was fine when it wasn't.",
      "I researched the game obsessively. I read every article, watched every video, followed every discussion thread. I learned about the classes and the races and the skills and the world. I learned about the economy and the politics and the social systems. I learned everything there was to know, except what it felt like to actually play. That was the one thing I couldn't learn without logging in.",
      "The headset had a neural interface. That was the revolutionary part. It connected directly to your brain, reading your thoughts and translating them into game actions. No controllers, no keyboards, no buttons. You thought about moving, and you moved. You thought about casting a spell, and you cast it. It was supposed to be seamless, intuitive, like using your own body. The idea terrified me.",
      "I worried about the risks. What if something went wrong? What if the interface damaged my brain? What if I got stuck in the game? What if I couldn't log out? The developers said it was safe, that they'd tested it extensively, that millions of people were using it without problems. But developers always said that. They always said their products were safe until they weren't.",
      "I thought about Yuna. What would she think if she knew I was playing a game while she lay in a hospital bed? She'd probably make fun of me. She'd probably say I was being a nerd. She'd probably want to play too. The thought made me smile, just a little, and then it made me sad, because she couldn't play. She couldn't do anything. She was just lying there, and I was here, hesitating over a headset.",
      "The headset was a bridge. Between me and Dad, between the real world and the virtual one, between who I was and who I might become. I didn't know if I wanted to cross that bridge. I didn't know what was on the other side. But the bridge was there, and eventually, I knew I'd have to decide whether to walk across it or turn away.",
      "I remembered Dad's voice. Not the exact words, but the tone. The way he sounded when he was proud of me, when he was worried about me, when he was trying to tell me something without actually saying it. He'd bought this headset for a reason. He'd wanted me to have it for a reason. I didn't know what the reason was, but I trusted him. I trusted that whatever he'd been thinking, whatever he'd been feeling, it had come from love.",
      "The game was called Endless Realms. Endless. That word stuck with me. Endless possibilities. Endless adventures. Endless life. My life felt like the opposite of endless. It felt finite, limited, bounded by grief and responsibility and the crushing weight of survival. The game offered something my life didn't: a future. A future that wasn't just more of the same.",
      "I made a decision. Not a good decision or a bad decision, just a decision. I would try it. I would put on the headset and log in and see what happened. If it was terrible, I could stop. If it was a waste of time, I could quit. But at least I would know. At least I wouldn't spend the rest of my life wondering what Dad had wanted me to see."
